Travel Expert website is an ongoing threaded workshop where the goal was to create a user friendly website that is appealing to the general public. The website also included a back-end component where it connected to the database using MySQL and PHP. Some of the highlighted feature of the website was a login/logout page, a contact page, and a registration page. My role in this project was to design the front-end from scratch (no templates) and upload to a web server. In addition, I helped my teammates display data which was pulled from MySQL

In the 2nd phase of the threaded workshop, our group had to create a desktop application and a web application using C#, SQL Server and ASP.NET. For the desktop application, the objective was to allow the Travel Agents manage their packages and make amendments as needed. The web portion of the workshop was to store the company’s customer information in a secure environment. My role for this group assignment was to design the interface for the application in C# and create the package page where a user can edit, update and delete the packages on file.

2018 Calgary Hacks (Hackathon) 5th place.<br>
The theme of the Hackathon was “long-ranged Internet of Things” where we had to use sensors associated with a Particle Electron Board that was provided to us. Our group created a functional rescue robot (Rescue Wolverine) that was remoted controlled and placed in areas that a person might not be able to enter and detect movement using PIR motion sensor within a 3 to 5-meter radius. Once a signal was picked up, Wolverine was able to send a response to the website (using jQuery to grab JSON data from the Particle cloud). My role in the team was to create a website, build up a web server and assisted my team members to connect the signal sent by Wolverine and display the real time data on our website. We were one of the few groups that were able to compete all of the required tasks on time. The technologies used was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, C++, Bootstrap and the Particle Electron Kit.
